## Random songs

Sometimes the weight of the world on your shoulders

Is to much to bear

Coping mechanisms taking over

But it makes you so unaware

How can I hammer it home?

Hold on to something dear when it's over

And your love isn't there

Forget all the things that define you

Or you'll be burning out

I don't blame you for the silent shouts

I don't blame you for being without

'Cause you're so unaware

How can I hammer it home?

You're so unaware

How can I hammer it home?

You could strike a gold mine

All on your own

Treasure kept in confines

But it would mean nothing, no!
